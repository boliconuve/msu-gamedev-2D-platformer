# Discovering the unknown - 2D platformer
I have created a 2D platform game made in Unity 3D. 

My main goal with this project is to learn and apply art, design and programming concepts. I made this approach to grow my knowledge within my chosen discipline, while art, design and code come together to make a game. To become a better game developer.

# The concepts I have learned:
  - Creating 2D games in Unity.
  - Creating and using Tilemaps.
  - Creating and using Tiles.
  - Creating 2D sprite animations.
  - Working with the animator to create state transitions between animations.
  - Working with Unity's input system.

# Other concepts I've also learned:
  - Working with prefabs.
  - Creating user interface (UI) such as menus and head-up displays (HUD).
  - More C# programming, creating scripts from scratch.
  - Working with Visual Studio Code to write my code.
  - Using Unity best practices.
  - Using Unity's best tips and techniques.
